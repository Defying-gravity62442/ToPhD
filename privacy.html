  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 25, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to ToPhD. This Privacy Policy explains how ToPhD, operated by Heming Gao ("I," "me," or "the operator"), collects, uses, and shares information when you use the ToPhD application (the "App"). I am committed to protecting your privacy and securing your data through end-to-end encrypted architecture.</p>

  <p>A core part of the App relies on third-party Artificial Intelligence (AI) services. By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that certain data will be processed as outlined in this policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the App.</p>

  <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> ToPhD is a personal open-source project created by an undergraduate student to help fellow undergraduates planning graduate school. This service is provided completely free.</p>

  <h2>Privacy at a Glance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What I Collect:</strong> Google account information for login, end-to-end encrypted content you create (journals, goals), calendar data if you grant permission, and interaction data.</li>
    <li><strong>How I Use It:</strong> Your data is used to provide the App's core services and to power AI-driven features for journaling and goal-setting.</li>
    <li><strong>Who I Share It With:</strong> To power certain features, necessary data is shared with AI service providers (Perplexity, Amazon Bedrock) and your connected calendar provider (e.g., Google). <strong>Personal data is never sold.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Your Content is Encrypted, With a Key Exception:</strong> To use AI or Calendar features, relevant content is first decrypted <strong>on your device</strong>. This plaintext data is then sent through the server to the third-party provider. The server acts only as a secure relay and does not log or store this decrypted content.</li>
    <li><strong>You Are in Control:</strong> You can export a copy of your data, delete content (subject to a cooling-off period), and permanently delete your entire account and all associated data at any time directly within the App.</li>
  </ul>
