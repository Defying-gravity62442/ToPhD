**AI and Calendar Services:** When you use AI and Calendar features, selected content is temporarily decrypted on your device and securely transmitted to the server, processed, and transmitted to third-party AI providers (such as Perplexity or Amazon Bedrock). This data is not stored by the server beyond processing your request.

**Calendar Integration:** If you connect external calendar services, relevant data will be shared with your calendar provider as necessary to provide requested functionality.

**Data Processing:** For complete details on how data is collected, used, and protected, please review the Privacy Policy.

## 6. Third-Party Services
